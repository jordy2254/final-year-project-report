\section{Aims and Objectives}
		\subsection{Aims}
		The aim of this project is to create a real-time indoor location tracking system. The system will aim to be affordable and expandable so it could be installed in variety different locations easily without loads of adaptations. This will mean ensuring that any calibration of equipment is easy to do for an end user. The mapping system is easy to adapt to new locations and more.

		\subsection{Objectives}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Develop a positioning system with a high level of accuracy
			\item Develop a positioning system that has a generic easily adaptable to suit a range of locations
			\item Develop a web application and management console for userâ€™s to create maps
			\item Use an efficient path finding algorithm to guide a user to the desired location
			\item Have a user-friendly UI
			\item Be able to edit the path finding algorithm for disabled users IE: Avoid stairs and only use lifts.
			\item Have a system that can give directions to the user from one location to another without real-time location tracking
