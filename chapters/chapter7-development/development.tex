\section{Implementation/Development}
The following chapter will cover interesting problems that arose during development, including why they where interesting, how they happened, and how the problem was solved. In addition to this the chapter will also cover the key stages of development and the produced artefacts comparing to that of the user stories/requirements identified above

\subsubsection{Room Polygon calculation}
The Rest application was the first element built during development and based on the designs rooms are stored with dimensions and then a series of indents. This works well however it did cause an issue.
Interesting things i found during development, the first of these was the algorithm to turn renctangles and indents into a polygon, it was alot more complicated than initially thought and something that wasn't covered on the internet after some searching.

The algorithm to do this works by yadadada

\subsubsection{Location calculation}
\subsection{Implementation Artefacts}
The below section is going to highlight the different results of the implementation, this will mostly consist of some screenshots of each section of the program. The aim of this is to demonstrate the basic overview of what was developed as part of the system.

\subsubsection{Web}
\subsubsection{Android}
\subsubsection{Rest API}
