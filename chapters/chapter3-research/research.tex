\section{Research}
There is a range of different technologies and algorithms that can be used to calculate a userâ€™s location and bring them to their desired location. As such the aim of this literature review is to research, understand and critique these different technologies/algorithms required for the implementation of the system. It will be understood by the end of the research any algorithms that are needed and in addition what technology is being used in order to implement the system.
