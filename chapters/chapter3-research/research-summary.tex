\subsection{Research Summary}
The above literature review has decided on the technologies and some of the algorithms to be used within the application, the first of these was the path finding algorithm where A* was found to be the most appropriate. The primary focus of the literature review was however the different technologies that can be used for location tracking such as WI-FI, Bluetooth and ultra-wide band, of all the solutions and technologies found Bluetooth was the most fitting in order to meet the project goal of having something universal that works on a majority of devices as a stand alone system.

Although Bluetooth is currently the best implementation for the target goals it’s not the best technology found in the research. Instead this goes to UWB, this technology is probably the future of indoor positioning systems, with several companies already offering solutions to this, such as Sewio which targets large businesses such as Budweiser. In addition to industry support from implementations UWB is now also starting to be added to smartphones such  as the IPhone 11 and Samsung Galaxy Note 20. Finally Google are also working on adding generic support for UWB into the Android SDK, which shows UWB possibly becoming a normal thing to see in smartphones. Taking into considerations of these points, it’s important to implement a system that is generic and untied to implementation details so as technologies improve the system can also improve.
