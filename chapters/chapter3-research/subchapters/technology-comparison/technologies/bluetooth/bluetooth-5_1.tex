\subsubsection{Bluetooth 5.1}
Bluetooth has recently come out with itâ€™s 5.1 standard, this features angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) functionality \citetemp. Several white papers already exist on the use of 5.1 for positioning systems demonstrating positive results with accuracy possible down to the centimetre \citetemp. Unfortunately this technology isn't applicable for the project goals due to it being relatively new many devices don't contain the chips required for this standard \citetemp therefore limiting the system to newer smartphones. Another downside of this approach is AoA and AoD both require antenna arrays making the footprint of the sensor larger and making it more obvious they exist than the beacon alternative.
