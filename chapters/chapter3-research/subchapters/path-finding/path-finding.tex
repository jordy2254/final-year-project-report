\subsection{Path Finding}
Path finding is an important part of an application that aims to locate user and guide them to their desired location. For this reason, this section will focus on the different algorithms available to find a path to a desired location. One of the key points of the chosen algorithm is that it must not take up a large amount of processing power. This is due to it needing to be executed on mobile devices and not rely on a server to compute the path.
