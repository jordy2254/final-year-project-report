\subsubsection{Dijkstra's}
Dijkstra’s algorithm is a breadth first search algorithm that can traverse weighted graphs and find the shortest path through them to an end location. Unlike A* and Uniform cost search Dijkstra’s spans out from the start point to the end point computing all paths in the process (REF). One of the key downsides of this is that Dijkstra’s has to traverse all of the graph blindly until there is no more solutions available. This computation contains a lot of wasted computing effort and there are better algorithms available (REF). Although in certain circumstances this trait of finding all possible paths to an end point could be advantageous such as if the start point is regularly changing (REF).
In addition to this Dijkstra’s traditionally also needs all nodes that are available given to it at the start of the algorithm. Doing this leads to high RAM usage for Dijkstra’s algorithm within large map applications (REF).
