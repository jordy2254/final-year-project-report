\subsubsection{Ultra wide band (UWB)}
UWB is a technology that has existed for a long time and is commonly cited to be used within indoor positioning systems. It has recently started growing more traction within the tech world with it's implementation within modern smart phones. This recent implementation happend with the iPhone 11 and Galaxy note 20 ultra in august 2020 \citetemp. With it's growing traction within the smartphone as well as the internet of things (IOT) such as the Galaxy Note smart-tag \citetemp it's showing promising results in becoming a normal addition to mobile devices as infrared, bluetooth and wireless charging are today. This can be further inferred knowing that Google have been expanding their android SDK  to contain generic support for UWB technology \citetemp. UWB is one of the few technologies that support AoA/AoD.\\

A majority of smartphones not having the capability for UWB within the device provides a drawback for the technology to be used to meet the aims and objectives of this project. This being said it appears with the strong adoption in the recent months from a range of large companies UWB will become a common thing to see in smartphones and other devices. For this reason it's important to implement the system with a focus on expanding technologies so the system can remain viable in the future.\\

There currently exists a few companies which provide UWB technology for indoor positioning within industrial application. One company found is a company called Sewio. This company has a range of clients including Volkswagen, Budweiser amongst other’s. UWB is still currently expensive Sewio start their kit's at €2850 for 5 tracking sensor's this is a high price pay for an every day user or small business therefore making unavailable to them. However with the constant adoption and addition into tech this price should reduce. It's well known that as technologies become more popular the price per unit decreases, \citetemp discusses this point highlighting the reasons this happens and the same should happen for UWB technologies as their use becomes more popular.
