Cheap and efficient real-time indoor positioning systems (IPS) are still not available to everyday user’s and small businesses. One of the possible causes of this holdback could be the cost of the initial setup/cost of equipment. Because the nature of an IPS is to guide someone around indoors it could pose many possible real-world applications for businesses such as guiding visitors around large buildings, Assisting the visually impaired around unknown locations without the need for someone to guide them, indoor robotics for factory’s/warehouses and more.
