\subsection{Research Summary}
The above literature review has covered a wide range of considerations required for the design and development of the system. It has established a path-finding algorithm to be used which is A*, due to it's adaptable nature, low memory footprint and fast running speeds. This chapter also highlighted a location tracking technology to use which is by using Bluetooth Eddystone beacons, again the reason for this was there lack of required networking, easy ability to install, cheap to maintain whilst still holding a great possibility for accurate positioning.
