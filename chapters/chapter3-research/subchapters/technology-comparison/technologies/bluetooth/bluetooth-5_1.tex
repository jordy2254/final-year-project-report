\subsubsection{Bluetooth 5.1}
The Bluetooth 5.1 standard, features Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure (AoD) functionality (\cite{lehtimki_bluetooth}). Several white papers already exist on the use of 5.1 for positioning systems demonstrating positive results with accuracy possible down to the centimetre (\cite{lehtimki_bluetooth}). Unfortunately, this technology isn't applicable for the project goals due to it being relatively new many devices don't contain the chips required for this standard. \cite{svetlik_2018_bluetooth} quotes the first android phone to support Bluetooth 5.1 was the Samsung Galaxy S8 therefore limiting the system to smart phones made within the past 4 years. It's important to also consider here that other companies and cheaper phones may not support this technology. Importantly at time of writing the author also doesn't possess a phone meeting this standard which will hinder the development. Another downside of this approach is AoA and AoD both require antenna arrays making the footprint of the sensor larger and making it more obvious they exist than the beacon alternative.
