\subsubsection{Ai based algorithms}
There exists a range of algorithms that can be written using AI. These algorithms include Ant colony Optimisation, Simulated annealing among others. Use cases for these algorithms are used to solve complex optimisation problems such as the travelling salesman problem. According to several papers such as (\citetemp \citetemp) which state “AI based approaches also require several iterations of the algorithm to be ran in order to find the more optimum route”. Due these reasons an AI based approach is not suited the desired application as path finding around a fixed map is better solved by other algorithms such as A*. In addition the multiple iterations needed for the algorithm run make it unsuited to be put on a mobile device where processing power, and battery are both limited.
