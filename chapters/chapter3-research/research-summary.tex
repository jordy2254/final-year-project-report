\subsection{Research Summary}
The above literature review has covered a wide range of considerations required for the design and development of the system. It has established a path-finding algorithm to be used which is A*, this is due to it’s easily adaptable nature. It has also selected a technology to use for location tracking itself which is by using Bluetooth eddystone beacons. This again is because of cheapness to use with still high levels of accuracy.
Research relating toward implementation details such as programming languages and SDK’s, API’s and more will all follow within chapter “6.1 Design Considerations”
