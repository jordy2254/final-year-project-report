\section{Testing}
The below chapter is about the testing that was done during and after completion of development

\subsection{Unit Tests}
Core areas of system logic have been covered by various unit tests to ensure no regression happens once that functionality was written. It also allows an automated approach to develop to ensure that man power isn't an issue. Unit tests are not covering the whole system such as the UI and the UI is covered instead by the acceptance criteria on an individual user story. If there was to be further work in the future further unit/integration tests would be developed to achieve a full coverage of the code base.

\subsection{Acceptance Testing Results}
The user stories developed defined a list of scenario's each under a given, when, then structure so that testing could be done directly in accordance to the requirements, development was also done based on the user stories, as such testing was covered both when the development was done and also again at the end of the project to ensure there was no regression. A full table of the user story results can be found in \appendixtemp, a large majority of the acceptance testing past however some of these stories did fail,.the table in \appendixtemp covers a brief overview of what failed along with a reason, the evaluation chapter may focus on some of these elements specifically going into more details.
