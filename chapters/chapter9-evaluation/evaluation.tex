\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{What went well} %Project successes

\subsection{The non-complete and why}

\subsection{System limitations} 
Rectangle storage of rooms
Walls are included in the size of a room
No Z-co-ordinate only x,y. Floor's are detected by localised sensors which is untested due to environmental restraints.

\subsection{What I'd do differently next time}
Some extra design layouts to pre-vent reworking
Some extra time spent on scoping, project left scope and got more complicated too quickly, meaning some work wasn't finished
\subsection{Future Work}

\subsection{What I learnt} % Project Takeaway
React
Things about 2 rendering pixel by pixel IE: Line drawing algorithms, Filled Polygon rendering etc.
About JWT tokens
About indoor positioning
loads of other stuff

\subsection{Conclusion}
