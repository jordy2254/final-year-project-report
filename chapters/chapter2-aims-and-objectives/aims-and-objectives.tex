\section{Aims and Objectives}\label{aimssandobj}
		\subsection{Aims}
		The aim of this project is to create a general purpose real-time indoor location tracking system that could be applied to a range of locations and environments. It's important for the system  to be affordable and expandable so it could appeal to a variarity of businesses. finally it's important to develop the system generically enough that it could be installed in a different location and not need expert setup or lots of calibration.

		\subsection{Objectives}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Develop a positioning system with a high level of accuracy
			\item Develop a positioning system that has a generic easily adaptable to suit a range of locations
			\item Develop a web application and management console for userâ€™s to create maps
			\item Use an efficient path finding algorithm to guide a user to the desired location
			\item Have a user-friendly UI
			\item Be able to edit the path finding algorithm for disabled users IE: Avoid stairs and only use lifts.
			\item Have a system that can give directions to the user from one location to another without real-time location tracking
