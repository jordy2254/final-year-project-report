In order to make the application easy to use, design considerations have come from various existing map applications such as google maps and apple maps. These systems have heavily impacted the UI design of the application, so it can be familiar to user's coming from those platforms, making the system easy to use.

The design of the system happened in several in stages which are detailed below.

\subsubsection{User stories}
\subsubsection{Test plan}
%Maybe requirements testing? i n eed to make ui tests too :sickface:
Below is a test plan based on the requirements analysis and user stories from previous sections. This test plan will be reviewed for the next iterative piece of development and will also be used for final testing to ensure the project goals are met.

\subsubsection{Architecture overview}
With the system being modular and containing several key parts that need to function appropriately together and architecture overview diagram has been generated to show how the system intends to work

\subsubsection{Data Storage}
I don't know an erd I guess and data dictionary, maybe some other database design things here too. discuss the choices as well.
