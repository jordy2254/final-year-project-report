%not critiqing the algotithm to implement the system 
There is a range of different technologies and algorithms that can be used to calculate a userâ€™s location and bring them to their desired location. The aim of this literature review is to understand and critique these different technologies/algorithms required for the implementation of the system. In addition to this, the literature review will also contain two case studies directly looking at existing companies and why there out of reach for an everyday user for an affordable price. Lastly the outcome of this literature review will be that all necessary technologies needed for creating an indoor location tracking system are clearly understood.
