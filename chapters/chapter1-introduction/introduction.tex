	Cheap and efficient real-time indoor positioning systems (IPS) are still not available to everyday user’s and small businesses. The biggest holdback of this is the cost of the initial setup. An IPS can have many real-world applications for businesses such as guiding visitors around large buildings, Assisting the visually impaired around unknown locations without the need for someone to guide them, indoor robotics for factory’s/warehouses and more.
