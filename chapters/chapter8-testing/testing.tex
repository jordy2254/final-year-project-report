\section{Testing}
The below chapter is about the testing that was done during and after completion of development

\subsection{Unit tests}
Most of the testing during development consisted of unit tests to ensure core logic wouldn't get broken. As the rest API was simple CRUD with some authentation via JWT tokens it was decided the logic within here wasn't needed to be tested. 

The Android application contains a large chunck of the core logic, such as selecting way points, rendering the map and various other code. Elements that where external to the UI had unit tests written for them. Anything else was tested as part of development against the test plan. The next section cover's this test plan.
