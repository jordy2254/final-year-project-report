Bluetooth has recently come out with it’s 5.1 standard, this features angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) functionality. Using this would offer an ideal case of location tracking and according to the documentation has the ability of tracking down to several centimetres. The main issue with this approach is that Bluetooth 5.1 is a fairly new standard and many devices won’t support such functionality meaning whatever application is built wouldn’t be reachable to a wide host of devices. Another downside of using the AoA and AoD algorithms is large antennas are needed on the sensor’s so that the difference in time can be calculated such as this one below:
