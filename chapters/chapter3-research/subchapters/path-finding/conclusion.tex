\subsubsection{Conclusion}
From the above research it's clear that A* is the best suited algorithm to use for this project, to re-iterate some the points that make great application: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low memory footprint
	\item Fast and efficient
	\item Uses a heuristic to find the optimal route
	\item Adaptable to be penalised for certain elements/nodes IE: Stairs
\end{itemize}
