\subsubsection{AStar (A\*)}
The A* Algorithms is a powerful algorithm used in many games. Like UCS the algorithm uses weighted graph. The A* algorithm is faster than UCS and this is due to a heuristic value that takes notice of the location in relation to the end goal. This heuristic is they key difference between UCS and A* as having this allows A* to select the next node with the lowest cost AND closest to the goal as opposed to just the lowest cost \citetemp. For this reason A* will navigate towards the goal as opposed to spanning out from the start point, this in turn leads to A* being the fastest algorithm on this list. 
Below is a visual comparison of a UCS algorithm vs A* reinforcing what was said above: (\cite{majumder_2013_a})
