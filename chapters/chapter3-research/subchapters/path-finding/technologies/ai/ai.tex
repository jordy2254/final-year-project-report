\subsubsection{Ai based algorithms}
There exists a range of algorithms that can be written using AI. These algorithms include Ant colony Optimisation, Simulated annealing among others. Use cases for these algorithms are used to solve complex optimisation problems such as the travelling salesman problem. According to several papers such as (\citetemp \citetemp) which state “AI based approaches also require several iterations of the algorithm to be ran in order to find the more optimum route”.\\
Requiring several iterations for the algorithm requires more processing power this not only means it takes longer to execute but also uses more battery power rendering it unsuitable for mobile devices. Due to the above preliminary AI based based approaches where decided to not be a good fit for the path finding and as such no further reading was done into these subject.
