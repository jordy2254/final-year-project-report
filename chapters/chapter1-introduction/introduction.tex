%bigger summery of IPS, and then come in with the catch of costs. what about medium companies
Cheap and efficient real-time indoor positioning systems (IPS) are still not available to consumers and small businesses. One of the potential causes of this holdback is the cost of the initial setup or equipment. An IPS has a range of potential uses such as guiding visitors around large buildings their unfamiliar with, assisting the visually impaired, indoor robotics for factoryâ€™s/warehouses. By the end of this paper an indoor positioning system will have been developed that can guide a user around a location taking them between two points. In addition the project will also design an implement the surrounding infrastructure for the creation of maps and synchronising them to a device.
