		There is a range of different technologies and algorithms that can be used to calculate a userâ€™s location and bring them to their desired location. The aim of this literature review is to understand and critique these different technologies/algorithms. In addition to this the literature review will also contain 2 case studies directly looking at existing companies and why there out of reach for an everyday user for an affordable price. 
		By the end of this literature review it will be understood all the necessary technologies needed for creating an indoor location tracking system.
