\subsubsection{Ai based algorithms}
There exists a range of algorithms that can be written using AI. These algorithms include Ant Colony Optimisation, Simulated Annealing among others. Use cases for these algorithms are used to solve complex optimisation problems such as the travelling salesman problem. According to several papers such as (\citetemp \citetemp) which states “AI based approaches also require several iterations of the algorithm to be ran in order to find the more optimum route”.\\
Several iterations for the algorithm requires more processing power, this not only means it takes longer to execute but also uses more battery power rendering it unsuitable for mobile devices. Due to the above preliminary research AI based approaches is was decided to not be fitting for the project thus no further research was done on this subject.
