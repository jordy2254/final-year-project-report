# final-year-project-report
This repo holds all the latex files for my final year project report.

# Building
The project was created with the MikTex repo on Ubuntu, to build the project run
"pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode --shell-escape project.tex"

The --shell-escape is needed for the wc to automatically be placed on the title page
