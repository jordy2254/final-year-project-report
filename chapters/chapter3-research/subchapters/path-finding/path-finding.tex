\subsection{Path Finding}
Path finding is an important part of the application, in order to meet the basic aims and objectives identified in chapter \ref{aimssandobj} it's important to have an efficient path finding that can guide the user to their desired location. In addition to this there is a requirement for the ability to modify the path finding making it can adaptable for different scenarios such as avoiding stairs for disabled users. Finally the chosen algorithms should be memory efficient and fast to run because it needs to run on a range of mobile phones. There is a range of algorithms that are viable for this and this section will focus on these different algorithms.
