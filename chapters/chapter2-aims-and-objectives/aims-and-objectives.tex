\section{Aims and Objectives}\label{aimssandobj}
\subsection{Aims}
The aim of this project is to create a general purpose real-time indoor location tracking system that could be applied to a range of locations and environments. It's important for the system  to be affordable and scaleable so it could appeal to a variety of businesses. Finally, it's important to develop the system generically enough so that it could be installed in a different location and not need expert setup or lots of calibration.

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop a positioning system with a high level of accuracy
	\item Develop a positioning system that is generic and also easily adaptable to suit a range of locations
	\item Develop a web application and management console for users to create maps
	\item Develop disability friendly features
	\item Develop a real-time system to direct users from one location to another
	\item Implement an efficient path finding algorithm to guide the user to their desired location
\end{itemize}
